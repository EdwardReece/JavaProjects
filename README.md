Programming in Java – Week 6 Assignment

Create a class named Poem that contains fields for the name of the poem and the number of lines in it. Include a constructor that requires values for both fields. Also include get methods to retrieve field values. Create three subclasses: Couplet, Limerick, and Haiku. The constructor for each subclass requires only a title; the lines field is set using a constant value. A couplet has two lines, a limerick has five lines, and a haiku has three lines. Create an application that demonstrates usage of an object of each type. Save the files as Poem.java, Couplet.java, Limerick.java, Haiku.java, and DemoPoems.java.

Write a try block in which you prompt the user for an integer and display the name in the requested position. Create a catch block that catches the potential ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException thrown when the user enters a number that is out of range. The catch block also should display an error message. Save the file as BadSubscriptCaught.java.
